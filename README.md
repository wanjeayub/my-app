## NextJS Portfolio Project

This is a project to showcase my skills in development using NextJS and more importantly development of both SSR components and CSR components which a done seamlessly in NextJS.

# This project is still a work in progress and I work on it twice in a week - balancing my day job :)

Most of the pages are complete (styling). The pending things for this project include:
  - The Contact page. I am working to integrate an API (emailJS) to enable emails to be sent to my personal email account
  - Services page. The content for this page is to be changed accordingly
  - Work page. The content is to be adjusted t point to my projects on github

All other functionalities work as expected

To learn more about it, clone the repository then run npm install to install all dependencies.
Then run any of the following commands

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```
